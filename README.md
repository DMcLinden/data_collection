# Data collection for Idea networks (aka concept mapping)

*Manual data collection*
* The word document entitled *Instructions and forms for paper data collection* contains forms for collecting data.  
    * The sorting portion explains the process of sorting and then provides a recording form for participants to record their result.  
    * A template for rating is also provided to which the ideas or statements can be pasted.  
* Data from the sort recording sheets can be entered into excel in the format described by the R code for reshaping "*racked* data.  The R code for reshaping the data will create a summary matrix of sorting data that can be analyzed using the concept mapping program in R.

There are no recommended programs for analyzing rating data as this tends to be easily accomplished with any number of tools (e.g., Excel, SPSS, etc.)

*Online sorting data collection*
* *Sorting for meaning*:  I often use OptimalSort at [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/?uxp_welcome=1) to collect sorting data.  When the data collection is complete I download the data using the option to download Raw Data as a csv file.  That data can be reshaped by the R code for reshaping "stacked" data.  That R code for reshaping the data will create a summary matrix of sorting data that can be analyzed using the concept mapping program in R.  
* I recently discovered two other online sorting tools, I have not tried these tools in projects, so I cannot offer any insights based on experience. I have used their demos/trials and like the user experience for participants.  These are [UsabiliTest](https://www.usabilitest.com/) and [SimpleCardSort](https://www.simplecardsort.com/).

*Sorting for values*
There are no recommended programs for collecting rating data online as this tends to be easily accomplished with any number of online survey tools. However an option is to use an *closed* sort instead of rating.  In a closed sort you pre-determine the categories (e.g., levels of importance, levels of feasibility) and participants sort the items/cards into these pre-determined categories to indicate the value they assign to each of the ideas.  An advantage of this approach, is that the task seems to cause participants to be more thoughtful about spreading the items/cards among the different values. Online sorting programs typically offer both an open sort and a closed sort as options.
