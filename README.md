# Data collection for Idea networks (aka concept mapping)

*Manual data collection*
* The word document entitled *Instructions and forms for paper data collection* contains forms for collecting data.  
    * Sorting
      * The sorting portion explains the process of sorting and then provides a recording form for participants to record their result.  
      * Assumes you can create a stack of cards with one idea per card and each card contains an identification number and the text of the idea.  The numbers used for identifying ideas need be numbered sequentially beginning with the number 1 through to the maximum number of cards.
      * Each person is given a stack of cards to sort.  Creating the stack can involve printing and then cutting sheets.  
         * Do **not** print a sheet of all of the same items.  This will create the difficult task of sorting all of those items into separate stacks, a tedious time-consuming task that is prone to error.
         * **Do** create a sheet(s) with the items from 1 to N and then cut and stack those items to create one stack.  A common misconception that causes unnecessary work is trying to create the stack so that cards are in order from 1 to N.  This is not necessary, you only need to be sure that each stack of cards has all of the ideas.
    * A template for rating is also provided to which the ideas or statements can be pasted.  
* Data from the sort recording sheets can be entered into excel in the format described by the R code for reshaping "*racked* data.  The R code for reshaping the data will create a summary matrix of sorting data that can be analyzed using the concept mapping program in R.

There are no recommended programs for analyzing rating data as this tends to be easily accomplished with any number of tools (e.g., Excel, SPSS, etc.)

*Online sorting data collection*
* *Sorting for meaning*:  I often use OptimalSort at [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/?uxp_welcome=1) to collect sorting data.  When the data collection is complete I download the data using the option to download Raw Data as a csv file.  That data can be reshaped by the R code for reshaping "stacked" data.  That R code for reshaping the data will create a summary matrix of sorting data that can be analyzed using the concept mapping program in R.  
* I recently discovered two other online sorting tools, I have not tried these tools in projects, so I cannot offer any insights based on experience. I have used their demos/trials and like the user experience for participants.  These are [UsabiliTest](https://www.usabilitest.com/) and [SimpleCardSort](https://www.simplecardsort.com/).  

*Online ratings*
There are no recommended programs for collecting rating data online as this tends to be easily accomplished with any number of online survey tools. 

*Sorting for values*  
An alternative to ratings is to use sorting, specifically, a *closed* sort.  In a closed sort you pre-determine the categories (e.g., levels of importance, levels of feasibility) and participants sort the items/cards into these pre-determined categories to indicate the value they assign to each of the ideas.  An advantage of this approach, is that the task seems to cause participants to be more thoughtful about spreading the items/cards among the different levels of measurement. Online sorting programs typically offer both an open sort and a closed sort as options.
