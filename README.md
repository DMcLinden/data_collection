*Manual data collection*
* The word document entitled *Instructions and forms for paper data collection* contains forms for collecting data.  
    * Sorting
      * The sorting portion explains the process of sorting and then provides a recording form for participants to record their result.  
      * Assumes you can create a stack of cards with one idea per card and each card contains an identification number and the text of the idea.  The numbers used for identifying ideas need be numbered sequentially beginning with the number 1 through to the maximum number of cards.
      * Each person is given a stack of cards to sort.  Creating the stack can involve printing and then cutting sheets.  
         * Do **not** print a sheet of all of the same items.  This will create the difficult task of sorting all of those items into separate stacks, a tedious time-consuming task that is prone to error.
         * **Do** create a sheet(s) with the items from 1 to N and then cut and stack those items to create one stack.  A common misconception that causes unnecessary work is trying to create the stack so that cards are in order from 1 to N.  This is not necessary, you only need to be sure that each stack of cards has all of the ideas.
    * A template for rating is also provided to which the ideas or statements can be pasted.  
* Data from the sort recording sheets can be entered into excel in the format described by the R code for reshaping "*racked* data.  The R code for reshaping the data will create a summary matrix of sorting data that can be analyzed using the concept mapping program in R.
