Data collection for concept mapping

MANUAL DATA COLLECTION
The word document entitled "Instructions and forms for paper data collection" contains forms for collecting data.  The sorting portion explains the process of sorting and then provides a recording form for participants to record their result.  A template for rating is also provided to which the ideas or statements can be pasted.  

Data from the sort recording sheets can be entered into excel in the format described by the R code for reshaping "racked" data.  That R code for reshaping the data will create a summary matrix of sorting data that can be analyzed using the concept mapping program in R.

There are no recommended programs for analyzing rating data as this tends to be easily accomplished with any number of tools (e.g., Excel, SPSS, etc.)

ONLINE DATA COLLECTION
I often use OptimalSort by OptimalWorkshop.com to collect sorting data.  When the data collection is complete I download the data using the option to download Raw Data as a csv file.  That data can be reshaped by the R code for reshaping "stacked" data.  That R code for reshaping the data will create a summary matrix of sorting data that can be analyzed using the concept mapping program in R.

There are no recommended programs for collecting rating data online as this tends to be easily accomplished with any number of tools.
